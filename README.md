# 'Rona Round UP! - Covid Defenders
#### Eric Alfaro & Zhongyou Wu 

### Disclaimer:
Covid-19 is a very serious problem that has taken millions of lives around the world.
This program is in no way attempting to disrespect or trivialize these matters.
It was made in the hopes that people could have fun and for us to demonstrate computer science knowledge in the 'Rona Round UP! hackathon.

# Covid Defenders
Do you ever look at someone and wonder, what is going on inside their lungs? Probably not, but regardless Covid Defenders lets you fend off Covid-19 in a tower defense game!
Your main goal is to strategically place body cells around a map and fend off waves of Covid from reaching the end of the path.

Every virus that passes your goal decreases your % of healthy cells, so its imperative that you stay above 0%.
Your best defense is some of your immune cells: The B cell, Macrophage, and Dendrite.
Drag one of the cells from the top right of your screen and drop it on the map!

Each type of cell is unique and can even be upgraded!
Click on a placed cell to select it and click on the arrow button on the bottom right to upgrade it.
You must think wisely, because you can only place and upgrade cells if you have the required RNA.
You can get more RNA as you defeat viruses and by getting rid of a body cell by clicking on the $ after selecting it.
The value shown under the name is what you will get in return (half of what you've spent on that cell).


## The Cells
### B Cell
Stat | Value
 --- | --- 
Cost | 40 RNA
Damage | 2 
Hit speed | 0.8 seconds 
Range | Medium
Upgrade Cost | 50 RNA
Upgraded Damage | 3
Upgraded hit speed | 0.75 seconds

The B Cell is a reliable and cheap unit with medium range, damage, and hit speed!
It creates antibodies and fires them at nearby viruses. These antibodies automatically track the virus they were fired at.

### Macrophage
Stat | Value
 --- | --- 
Cost | 55 RNA
Damage | 1
Hit speed | 1.3 seconds
Range | Low
Upgrade Cost | 40 RNA
Upgraded Damage | 2
Upgraded hit speed | 1.1 seconds

The Macrophage might have lower stats than the B Cell overall, but it makes up with its special projectile. When it splits, it's other half goes through all viruses! Macrophages are very powerful for defending clumps of Covid if placed well.

### Dendrite
Stat | Value
 --- | --- 
Cost | 80 RNA
Damage | 9
Hit speed | 2.2 seconds
Range | High
Upgrade Cost | 50 RNA
Upgraded Damage | 14
Upgraded hit speed | 1.5 seconds

The Dendrite is initially a big investment but its power and range pay off. Its overwhelmed by large amounts of Covid and very powerful against bosses.
